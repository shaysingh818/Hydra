# Summary
Hydra is a system for implementing reinforcement learning algorithms. This paradigm of learning requires us to represent an agent, state and environment. Games, specifically with two dimensional environments can easily represent RL problems. Algorithms can be used to manage the state and create learning strategies. The purpose of this project, is to learn about various methods to represent a game environment, create libraries for implementing reinforcement learning algorithms and understand the fundamentals of creating “simple” games that agents can play.  

## Machine Learning Strategy
This purpose of the engine is to research different machine learning methods for developing AI’s that learn to solve puzzles easily. The game’s are not the same, as a result, it will require different ML models and environment representations. For each game, this will be the format for developing algorithms and environments.
	1. Represent the environment of the game
	2. Test the environment, make sure it’s playable 
	3. Research RL/ML algorithms to learn the environment
	4. Create bench marking and test cases
	5. Test accuracy of implemented models

## Two Dimensional Game Environments
1. Tic-Tac-Toe
2. Connect 4
3. Tetris
4. Sudoku
5. 2048
6. Checkers
7. Scrabble
