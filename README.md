# Summary
Hydra is a system for implementing reinforcement learning algorithms. This paradigm of learning requires a representation of an agent, state and environment. Games, specifically with two dimensional environments, can easily represent RL problems. Algorithms can be used to manage the state and create learning strategies. The purpose of this project, is to learn about various methods to represent a game environment, create libraries for implementing reinforcement learning algorithms and understand the fundamentals of creating “simple” puzzles that agents can solve.
